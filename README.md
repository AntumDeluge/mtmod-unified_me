#**WHAT:**
*"A mod which aims to run faster than other API, to give a nice experience 
while allowing more performance to the game than the well-known Mobs Redo"* 
I'm very proud of this API, it might even replace mobs_redo in some cases! 
It got really playable, even if it's still quite unstable... for now! 
This is an API, so check the other files (api_help.lua, settings.lua) to start modding with it!
The modpage also links to "compoments" that really adds mobs. (most of the informations
here are subjects to big and irregular changes. I am trying to keep this file up-to-date)
