Not So Simple Mobs by NPX team

Starting from version 3.0 the mod depends on mobs_redo api:

We suggest that you play nssm with:
 - nssb (Not So Simple Buildings, our second mod that adds many blocks and Morlendor, the new dimension):
 - 3d_armors (with which you can use our armors):
 - unified_inventory (useful to discover the recipes and to use the armors):
 - a throwing mod (a mod that adda bows) if compatible with the Tenplus1's damage_system

We would like to thank:
 - PilzAdam, for his wonderful simple-mobs mod;
 - Tenplus1, for his hard work in making mobs_redo;
 - Echoes91, for Spears: simple but amazing;
 - and obviously Celeron-55 and all the people who contributed to Minetest and its community (and Paramat in particular);
 - Denise and Ponzi_Duro for the revision of the guide;
 - Double_P, Ponzi_Duro, Andrey01 and Taikedz for the beta testing;
 - Taikedz for his support and for hosting a server dedicated to nssm (Not So Simple Server: );
