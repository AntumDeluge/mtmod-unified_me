This is a summary of high-level features that are still missing,
not a detailed bug list.


1 - Monster persistence

Monsters should be persistent in the world: The default assumption
is that a world is generated by mapgen and is then mostly finished,
and any modification to the world afterwards is persistent.

For monsters, this means that mapgen should add monsters to the
mapblocks. If these monsters should die, they are in principle removed
from the world forever.

A `/clearobjects` call should not affect this. We can get this behavior
by using ABM's to respawn missing monsters. This may replace normal
block saving entirely, which is the default method to save/load entities.

Initial monster addition to the world should be done using generic
algorithms that use e.g. perlin noise to place monsters in the proper
locations, density and type.

Additonal spawning algorithms (e.g. respawning, or randomly spawning
more mobs after a while) should be optional and possibly done by
an external mod.
